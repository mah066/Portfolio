        Hi, I'm <strong>Muhammad Aazim Hasher</strong>, a passionate Computer Science student currently pursuing my undergraduate degree, <strong> BSc(Hons.) Computer Science at University of Manchester</strong>. Having a solid foundation in both hardware and software, I have a deep interest in software and game development, digital systems, and ethical computing.

      <p className="about-text">
        I’ve worked on a variety of academic and personal projects—from designing finite state machines and implementing processor datapaths in Verilog to developing engaging Python games like <em>Asteroid Dodger</em> using Tkinter. I also collaborated with a team to develop <strong>Thrifty Bee</strong>, a student-only e-commerce website with moderation tools, chat functionality, and secure authentication. These experiences strengthened my technical abilities as well as my teamwork, creativity, and time management skills..
      </p>
      <p className="about-text">
        In the past, I’ve worked as a web developer for a TV manufacturing brand and as an assistant manager in a home appliance shop. These experiences helped me gain both technical and customer-facing skills.

        I graduated Grade 12 from Infant Jesus Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School with an overall percentage of 95%, where I actively participated in extracurriculars— mainly winning first prize in a science exhibition and third in a one-act play competition.
      </p>
      <p className="about-text">
        I enjoy solving problems, building meaningful software, and constantly learning new technologies like C#, Unity, and more. I'm excited about my journey in the tech world and always open to collaborative opportunities!
